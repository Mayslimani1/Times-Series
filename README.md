# Forecasting Model - Machine Learning for Time Series

The core challenge of this project lies in the need to understand and predict energy consumption and production in Turkey over several years, using a detailed dataset comprising hourly data. This task is essential to ensure the stability and efficiency of the country's power grid, as well as to effectively plan energy supply and future investments in the energy sector. The complexity of the Turkish energy landscape, characterized by a diversity of energy production sources and demand variations influenced by multiple and variable factors, poses a significant challenge. Therefore, the challenge is to accurately and efficiently analyze and model these complex data to provide reliable and actionable forecasts for policymakers, grid operators, and energy market participants. 

The provided dataset offers a detailed insight into Turkey's energy landscape between 2018 and 2023, presenting crucial information on energy consumption and production, as well as associated prices. With hourly data, it allows for granular analysis of trends and variations in electricity demand and generation throughout the period considered. The amount of energy consumed, measured in megawatt-hours (MWh) per hour, is a fundamental indicator for assessing the nation's energy needs.

To address the challenge of forecasting energy consumption and production in Turkey, we developed five distinct models, each bringing a unique approach to short-term forecasting. First, we used the naive model as a benchmark, providing a baseline for evaluating the performance of other models. Next, we explored two univariate analysis approaches, namely ARIMA and Prophet, which focus on modeling trends and patterns in energy consumption and production data without considering other variables.

Concurrently, we also implemented two multivariate analysis approaches, LGBM and LSTM, which took into account interactions between different variables to improve forecast accuracy. These models were particularly effective in capturing the complex relationships between different energy production sources, electricity prices, and other factors influencing energy demand.

Our primary goal was to achieve short-term forecasts, specifically focusing on predicting the 6th hour based on data from the previous 5 hours. This approach enables increased responsiveness to rapid fluctuations in energy demand and production, which is crucial for ensuring grid stability and meeting real-time needs. By combining these different approaches, we were able to evaluate the relative performance of each model and identify the most effective methods for short-term forecasting in the Turkish energy context. This, in turn, helped develop valuable tools and techniques for efficient grid management and energy planning in the country.
